    "\n",
    "This is part of the final project on 620 Web Analytics course. Objective of this project is to create a resume chatbot for Shyam BV. This will provide most of the information about me.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a deep neural network with that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline which also uses text processing libraries. A question will be asked, an answer will be provided by bot. Also bot's ability to respond to new questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Creation** - Here we will create a dataset with various text inputs\n",
    "- **Preprocess** - You'll convert text to sequence of integers with various preprocessing.\n",
    "- **Models** - A Deep neural network model will be created. By creating a word embedding, this model will be able to learn new words.\n",
    "- **Prediction** - Run the model and generate responses from bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform this deep learning chatbot, we need to train the model with lots of data. Unfortunately my resume is not in format of QA(question answering type). So we need to generate lot of data with some existing data for this model.\n",
    " \n",
    "Here is a sample data which [I found](\n",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bvshyam/make_yourself_a_bot/master/workspace-watson.json). This will be me base to create a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the period, due to many interactions, we will gather more data and our bot will get better over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset creation\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, need create the initial dataset. That will be performed in  data_creation.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "As the model will be created using deep neural networks, we will be using Keras library with Tensorflow backend.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have successfully created a dataset with the existing data sources with automated and manual effort.\n",
    "2. Preprocessed the dataset and performed tokenization, padding, cleaning symbols, creating word dictinary.\n",
    "3. Loaded an pretrained word embeddings matrix(GLove) and used it to convert the vocab to a word embeddings 100 dimention matrix.\n",
    "4. Create a deep neural network model and input questions and answers to train the neural network.\n",
    "5. As the training takes longer time, we will run the training on a 8 GB GPU+ memory with 8 core, 30 GB RAM. It took ~2 hours to run 2500 epochs.\n",
    "6. Next step is to predict the new sentances which are typed. Lot of preprocessing needs to be performed on user entered text.\n",
    "7. Clean any symbols and tokenize the user input text. Also convert it to vector format.\n",
    "8. Finally all the input text, interpreted text and response text is stored in text file with date stamp for future training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flask App:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is also an flask app which was created for this interaction with the user. It is shown in the video and code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential exploration and development:\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this chatbot is providing some answers, there is a lot of space for improvements. Some of them are .\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Chatbot response in a proper grammatically correct way.\n",
    "2. Perform more preprocessing on the input text and finding correct match words for the unknown words.\n",
    "3. Create a sequence to sequence encoder-decoder model using bidirectional RNN. That will provide better results. I have tried to implement it. But require some  more time for deep exploration. \n",
    "4. Better UI for the chatbot. Currently UI is very simple and have minor issues in it."
